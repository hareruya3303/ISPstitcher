This folder contains the source routines for all of the methods employed in stitching images. Currently, the only files here relate to the generalized cross correlation of images in singleton on double dimensions. The in-place routines in the folder support arbitrary input dimensions and dimensions to reduce via sum, but the higher level routines acting on images only perform the gcc on matrices of RGB values.
